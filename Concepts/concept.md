## MemCached

- An item consists of key and value, where key is a string (250 chars).
- Value can be of any type (1MB configurable)
- Keys have expiration date

### Memory Management

- Memory allocation is random
- Items freed/allocated causes gaps
- Pages consist of chunks of fixed size

### LRU

- Memory is limited
- Items are evicted based on LRU
- It uses Linked list under the hood

### Read EXAMPLE

- We get the key, hash it and then mod it with the size of the hash table
- We get the page number from the hash table

### Write EXAMPLE

- We get the key, hash it and then mod it with the size of the hash table
- We get the page number from the hash table
- We get the chunk number from the page
- We write the value to the chunk
